The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Sunday, 21 January 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started the Advent of Code 2017 again from day 3, see here: http://adventofcode.com/2017

### R1D2
Workig on Advent of Code 2017, Day 03 Part 01. It's <sarcasm>not</sarcasm> kicking my ass at the moment.

### R1D3
Worked on dbachecks (PowerShell & Pester) and got a Pull Request in. Feels good to be back at it again.

### R1D4
Tried to add Jeff Hicks PowerShell module "myTasks".
  Installed correctly, imported correctly, and added a task correctly. However, when trying to use `Get-MyTask` to see the newly
added task, it failed with an error

>> _ImportTasks : Cannot convert argument "1", with value: "25/02/2018 15:28:07", for "MyTask" to type "System.DateTime": "Cannot convert value "25/02/2018 15:28:07" to type
"System.DateTime". Error: "String was not recognized as a valid DateTime.""

At least I know what I'll be working on the next hour of code anyway.
